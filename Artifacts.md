## **Low and High Frequency Drifts**
Low frequency noise comes from sources such as movement of the head and electrode wires, and perspiration on the scalp. Low frequency noise appears as slow drifts in the EEG signal over many seconds.

High frequency noise comes from sources including electromagnetic interference, and muscle contractions (especially facial and neck muscles). High frequency noise looks like rapid up-down changes (like the teeth of a saw) in the EEG.

Low and high frequency noise is removed during filtering. Filtering should always be done on continuous data before epochs are isolated

## **Heartbeat Artifacts (ECG)**
