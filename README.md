## **Instructions**  
You need Anaconda downloaded and installed to run this program. Please [download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) if you do not have it already before proceeding. 
### **Downloading the Code**  
1. Click the green button that says "Code"
2. Click download zip and extract to a location like your Desktop
  
### **Creating the Conda Environment**  
> * The $ before a line which you type into the terminal is not actually typed out in the terminal. This is just to signifiy that the line is to be inputed into the terminal.
> * **You should only need to create the Conda environment once**; if you've already created the environment, skip to [Running the Program](#running-the-program)
1. 
  - Mac: Control/right click the ERP folder you just extracted. Hold **Option** and click "Copy ERP as Pathname."
  - Windows: Press **shift** and right click the folder you just extracted, then click "Copy as path".
  - Linux: you should know how to do this...
1. Open a terminal window and enter this command:
      ```bash
      $ cd <paste pathname you just copied>
      ```
2. Once you're in the folder in a terminal window, enter the command:
    ```bash
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

### **Running the Program**  
1. Make sure the output OpenBCI file is a text (`.txt`) file. Move this to your folder with the program. 
2. Start the Conda environment:  
    ```bash
    $ conda activate ERP_env
    ```
3. Run the program:  
    ```bash
    (ERP_env) $ python ERP_experiment.py
    ```  
  
It may take a moment for the program to start running, especially the first time. After the configurations are loaded, enter your raw data file, ex. ```demo.txt``` and press enter.  
  
The default configuration is to dump the resulting image and cleaned data into an output folder. You can turn this off in the ```config.yml``` file.

### **Configuration File**  
You can edit the default configurations by modifying the `config.yml` file. The primary settings you may want to modify are:
- `sample_rate`: ensure that this matches the sample rate set in OpenBCI
- `t_min` and `t_max`: the time cutoffs (in seconds) before and after an event which define the length of an epoch
- `output_results`: set to True or False depending on if you want the results output to a folder each time the program is run
- `left_flash_condition_name` and `right_flash_condition_name`
- `number_of_left_flashes` and `number_of_right_flashes`: the number of expected events for each stimuli. It will be okay if these don't match, but it's is helpful when looking at the rejection rate or when modifying the rejection parameters.

## **EEG Preprocessing**
1. Trim data down to relevant timeframe based on start and end stimuli signals
2. **FILTERING:** Perform symmetric linear-phase FIR filter using the upper and lower passband edges specified in ```config.yml```<sup>1</sup>  
3. **EPOCH ISOLOATION:** Extract epochs from the continuous data using ```t_min``` and ```t_max``` specified in ```config.yml```
4. ***ARTIFACT REJECTION:*** Drop bad epochs using the rejection criteria specified in ```config.yml```  
5. *Since the displayed plot is generated using epochs in order to display the confidence band, epochs are later converted into evoked (averaged epochs) in order to output plotted data to a csv*


## **Artifact Rejection**
Artifacts are parts of the recorded signal that arise from sources other than the source of interest (i.e., neuronal activity in the brain). These can be caused by a variety of factors, such as electromagnetic field noise from nearby elevators or cell phones, instrument/sensor variation or manlfunctions, or natural biological occurences which cause electrical fluctuations in the brain such as heartbeats, blinks, eye movement, or swallowing.<sup>2</sup>  
  
While artifacts can be rejected or repaired in continous data, it is standard practice in ERP research to reject entire epochs using maximum acceptable peak-to-peak amplitudes. Since different set-ups or hardware will likely be used in repetition of this lab, the reject criteria may require some trial and error and fine tuning in the case of too many/few rejected epochs. This parameter can be modified in ```config.yml```. It may be useful to set the ```rejection_log_level``` to ```DEBUG``` while doing this to see which channels are causing epochs are being rejected.
