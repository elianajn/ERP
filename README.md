## **Instructions**  
You need Anaconda downloaded and installed to run this program. Please [download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) if you do not have it already before proceeding. 
### **1. Downloading the Code**  
1. Click the green button that says "Code"
2. Click download zip and extract to a location like your Desktop
  
### **2. Creating the Conda Environment**  
> * The $ before a line which you type into the terminal is not actually typed out in the terminal. This is just to signifiy that the line is to be inputed into the terminal.
> * You should only need to create the Conda environment once; if you've already created the environment, skip to [Running the Program](#running-the-program)
#### **Mac Instructions**
1. Control/right click the ERP folder you just extracted. Hold Option and click "Copy ERP as Pathname"
2. Open a terminal window
3. 
    ```bash
    $ cd <paste pathname you just copied>
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
#### **Windows Instructions**
<mark>TODO</mark>

### **Running the Program**  
1. <mark>TODO: format of the data file, move to it to this folder</mark>
2. Start the Conda environment:  
   `$ conda activate ERP_env`
3. Run the program:  
  `(ERP_env) $ python ERP_experiment.py`  
  *Note: You may need to specify that *   <mark>TODO PYTHON3 INSTRUCTIONS</mark>

It may take a moment for the program to start running, especially the first time. After the configurations are loaded, enter your raw data file, ex. ```demo.txt``` and press enter.  
  
The default configuration is to dump the resulting image and cleaned data into an output folder. You can turn this off in the ```config.yml``` file

### **CC Neurophysiology Student Instructions**
<mark>TODO</mark>

## **EEG Preprocessing**
1. Trim data down to relevant timeframe based on start and end stimuli signals
2. **FILTERING:** Perform symmetric linear-phase FIR filter using the upper and lower passband edges specified in ```config.yml```
3. **EPOCH ISOLOATION:** Extract epochs from the continuous data using ```t_min``` and ```t_max``` specified in ```config.yml```
4. ***ARTIFACT REJECTION:*** Drop bad epochs using the rejection criteria specified in ```config.yml```  
5. *Since the displayed plot is generated using epochs in order to display the confidence band, epochs are later converted into evoked (averaged epochs) in order to output plotted data to a csv*


## **Artifact Rejection**
<mark>TODO</mark>  
Artifacts are parts of the recorded signal that arise from sources other than the source of interest (i.e., neuronal activity in the brain). These can be caused by a variety of factors, such as electromagnetic field noise from nearby elevators or cell phones, instrument/sensor variation or manlfunctions, or natural biological occurences which cause electrical fluctuations in the brain such as heartbeats, blinks, eye movement, or swallowing.<sup>1</sup>  
  
While artifacts can be rejected or repaired in continous data, it is standard practice in ERP research to reject entire epochs using maximum acceptable peak-to-peak amplitudes. Since different set-ups or hardware will likely be used in repetition of this lab, the reject criteria may require some trial and error and fine tuning in the case of too many/few rejected epochs. This parameter can be modified in ```config.yml```. It may be useful to set the ```rejection_log_level``` to ```DEBUG``` while doing this to see which channels are causing epochs are being rejected.
